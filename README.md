# Penguin Randomizer

Penguin Randomizer is an app for Linux that opens files in a folder in a random order.

The files are opened in the system's default application rather than inside Penguin, Penguin just opens files in the selected folder in a purely randomized order and eliminates duplicates. It works best with simple files such as images and videos that are opened in a fast-launching app.
